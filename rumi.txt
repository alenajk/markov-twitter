A moment of happiness,
you and I sitting on the verandah,
apparently two, but one in soul, you and I.
We feel the flowing water of life here,
you and I, with the garden's beauty
and the birds singing.
The stars will be watching us,
and we will show them
what it is to be a thin crescent moon.
You and I unselfed, will be together,
indifferent to idle speculation, you and I.
The parrots of heaven will be cracking sugar
as we laugh together, you and I.
In one form upon this earth,
and in another form in a timeless sweet land. 

Any soul that drank the nectar of your passion was lifted.
From that water of life he is in a state of elation.
Death came, smelled me, and sensed your fragrance instead.
From then on, death lost all hope of me. 

Birdsong brings relief
to my longing
I'm just as ecstatic as they are,
but with nothing to say!
Please universal soul, practice
some song or something through me! 

I have a fire for you in my mouth, but I have a hundred seals 
on my tongue. 
The flames which I have in my heart would make one mouth- 
ful of both worlds. 
Though the entire world should pass away, without the world 
I possess the kingdom of a hundred worlds. 
Caravans which are loaded with sugar I have in motion for 
the Egypt of nonexistence. 
The drunkenness of love makes me unaware whether I have 
profit of loss therefrom. 
The bodyâ€™s eye was scattering pearls because of love, till now 
I have a pearl-scattering soul. 
I am not housebound, for like Jesus I have a home in the fourth 
Heaven. 
Thanks be to Him who gives soul to the body; if the soul 
should depart, yet I have the soul of the soul. 
Seek from me that which Shams-e Tabrizi has bestowed, for 
I have the same.
